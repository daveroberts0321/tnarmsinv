   <h5> how everything works </h5>
<p> What we are trying to do </p>
<p> Our inventory and or brass/ejectors/build kits ect shut us down almost monthly. This system is designed 
to help with keeping track of all this</p>
<p> April</p>
<p> When you put in a purchase order, add it under "purchase orders" by color and model with the invoice #
. If we receive a partial shipment then update the system to what we still have open. When the whole order is complete then 
delete the entire order. Add up the total brass inserts/ejectors/serial num inserts for that order. Take it off 
the consumables count. This is done only when the order is submitted.</p>
<p>Amy/ JT</p>
<p>Amy will make a list of what items sold in what amounts the day before once a day. That list will be used by JT to pull the inventory from just this system. Nowhere else. 
I dont care if its getting shipped or not. If we are backordered 150 black recievers we need to show our available inventory as nothing even if they are still here.
This goes the same with the AR15 kits, Tac-9 arms (located in consumables btw) .... everything</p>
